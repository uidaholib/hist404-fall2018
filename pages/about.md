# About {{ site.title }}

This site was built using digitizations and metadata created by the Fall 2018 students of Professor Matthew Fox-Amato's History 404 class. Students spent several class sessions learning the fundamentals of digital library development. Each student selected, digitized, described, and provided access via this website to photographs and textual documents. 

The class worked with [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) staff using their [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/) tool to build this website.
